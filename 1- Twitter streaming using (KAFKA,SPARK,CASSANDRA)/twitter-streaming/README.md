# Twitter Streaming

In this work, using the best practicies, a realtime data pipline has been built to generate tweet metrics for Coutries arround the world.

The goal is to have the total number of tweets,retweets and active tweeters per City over a 5 minute interval.

The aggregated data is visualized using grafana, the visualiser allows visualizing the trends, and is reactive with time intevals.

## 1 - Architecture

![](images/Architecture.png)

In this architecture a container app will stream tweets using the Twitter v2 api, and will produce to a replicated kafka topic which has a time retention period to be determined.

The kafka cluster has two brokers, and two zookeepers, it's possible to use both brokers for producing to kafka and consuming from kafka (using spark). In this case the solution would be able to handle failovers, it's also possible to use each broker for a task, and we need to test using a heavy stream if any performance enhancement can come from this.

 Batch streaming will be done using 1 spark master node, it can be extensible by adding workers.

 The batch streaming is orchestrated by a "structured streaming" python app, which will stream data from kafka aggregate it and save it to Cassandra DB.

Grafana was chosen as the visualizer for its aesthetics, and ease of use.

## 2 - Code

#### A. Docker-compose :
a docker-compose file has been created, which upon start up will spin up the containers and run all the services.

#### B. Producer:
An encapsulated module was written for the purpose of streaming from twitter and producing to kafka, this can be upgraded by adding a generic filter or rules.

The producer app has been adapted so it can handle full kafka outages, when full kafka outage occurs the producer will write messages to disk instead of keep them in memory, please refer to section "8- Survive Kafka outages" for more details.

#### C. Stream processor:
A python driver script has been written to run against the master spark, the job will perform structured streaming from Kafka to Cassandra. The job will aggregate by city,time for a window of 5 minutes, it will also run every 1 minute.

#### D. Tester:
A tester container has been added, please refer to "tests" section for details.
  
  
  
## 3 - Startup script

 Please use ./start-all.sh, it contains the "docker-compose up". 
 
 The following was added "sed -i -e 's/\r$//' ./scripts/cassandra_init.sh".

This deals with replacing the encoding of CRLF file with LF.

If git is configured to transform the file from LF to CRLF, the mentioned line will fix it.

In order for the services to start correctly a wait time has been added to apps in the container, please be patient.

Please check section 5.B (Automated test) before starting the services.
 
 
## 4 - Visualization, queries, and restrictions

Please use the following http://localhost:3000/ to enter the grafana visualizer , use 'admin' as username and password.

In the dashboard section you will find counts and trends which are shown below.

Please wait for the services to start and tables to be populated, the casssandra db was not configured for data persistency. 


The below queries were used for trends, however a Where condition is missing on the city which will allow to return data of a single or multiple cities, the reason is  due to a bug in grafana, it was not able to query the unique cities from cassandra and return as a list of variables.
```
Select city,CAST(sum(count) as double),date from evilnet.tweets  where  date >= $__timeFrom and date <= $__timeTo group by city,date  ALLOW FILTERING;
```
```
Select city,CAST(sum(count) as double),date from evilnet.retweets  where  date >= $__timeFrom and date <= $__timeTo group by city,date ALLOW FILTERING;
```
```
Select city,CAST(sum(count) as double),date from evilnet.uniqueuserswhere  date >= $__timeFrom and date <= $__timeTo group by city,date  ALLOW FILTERING;
(unique users for time window were counted in spark streaming)
```
It's true that the queries are returning data of all cities, but cassandra can offord such queries continiously as the schema design was created to perform aggregation by city,date.

The maximum number of returned values from this query for an hour interval would be at worse 
1130 (number of all cities in canada) * 12 ( number of 5 mins in one hour) = 13560
Which can be handeled by grafana without compromising the refresh rate.

The approach is not perfect, but on the plus side the visualiser will display for the user the queried cities below the table without choosing from a list of variables.

The $__timeFrom and date <= $__timeTo can be controlled from the time bar and are passed to the query.

The motive of using cassandra for is to explore it and learn it, as it provides high performance and scalability. The query issue can be solved by switching to mongodb or pgsql,mysql.

![](images/trends.png)

The below queries were used for counts by cities over last hour, another imperfection was made in the query, as it was not possible to ORDER BY count, and LIMIT 5.

Instead the aggregation over cities was returned, the maximum number of values that could be returned is 1130.

Cassandra schema is a query based schema which will ensure performance, and data integrity on distributed machines, the schema was created to aggregate by city,date. And its not possible to sort without specifing a WHERE is equal operation. A solution is to add a partition key for all records, for exp key=1, and when sorting we can user the where condition key=1. 

The sorting is taking place in grafana instead.
```
Select city,CAST(sum(count) as double),date as aggsum from evilnet.retweets  where  date >= (toTimestamp(now()) - 1h) group by city  ALLOW FILTERING;
```
```
Select city,CAST(sum(count) as double),date as aggsum from evilnet.tweets  where  date >= (toTimestamp(now()) - 1h) group by city  ALLOW FILTERING;
```

## 5 - Tests

#### A. Fidelity test:
It's possible to miss messages coming from twitter due to routing or networking issues.

 Twitter infra is mostly on GCP and it's preferable to deploy next to an edge there, or in a GCP datacenter.

 If we are rooting for top accuracy, It's possible to do fidelity testing by streaming twitter data from multiple cloud locations.

 The process of streaming will start at the same time on similar machines but in different locations, it will endure for a large enough window, data can be collected for comparison.

 Finally, itâ€™s possible to collect the data and compare it, the comparison will allow us to infer which host has least missing records.

 #### B. Automated test:
 A test container has been added for the purpose of data validation. The goal of the test is to simulate the whole data pipline. In order for the
    pipline to go into test mode we need to change the variable IS_TEST=0 into IS_TEST=1 for the the producer in the docker compose file.
    
 ![](images/producerconfig.png)
 ![](images/producerconfig1.png)
    
 This will enable the producer to load a twitter json file instead of streaming from twitter, it will send the data to kafka as if the pipline is working normally, after that, spark will perform batch streaming and load the data into cassandra.

The tester container will query tweets,re-tweets, and unique users from cassandra, and will also load anchor data that was validated, it will then compare the data using pandas assert_frame_equal, if any difference occurs the container will output what it is.

NB: If the tester container is spin up when the producer is in a non testing mode (IS_TEST=0), it will absolutley return schema inqueality as it's comparing fresh data to anchored data. 

Please note that first time you start the test container, it will take time to build, this because it's building wheels for the phython libraries.

If you don't need the test and did not activate the IS_TEST, it's better to remove the container from docker compose.


## 6 - resource footprint analysis
  
Kafka queues and cassandra tables can have retention period, this will limit storage usage.

We can monitor the components using prometheus and grafana.
         
We could run the apps for a large enough period of time, ideally the peak usage should be 80 % of the total resource limit.
          
          
## 7- Scalability plan
  
In this pipline we need to take care of two main components, the producer, and the consumer (spark jobs).

The rest of the components are scalable by nature (kafka,spark,cassandra), if we manage these clusters we can monitor the nodes, and add nodes when needed.
        
 #### Producer Scalability:

 #### Strategy 1:

The producer app can take multiple Countries as argument, and for enterprise accounts, it's possible to add rules while streaming.

 #### Strategy 2:

We need to segregate (Countries,topics) in the same container. It's possible to perform threading or async in the same container in order to send each country tweet to a corresponding topic.

 #### Strategy 3

We need to segregate the load, cities, topics.

We can scale by adding producer containers that have specific County/Countries and topic, this can be done using jenkins, for example the inputs would look like the below.

![](images/producer.png)

The last startegy can really ease up the deploy especially if we wants to scale for the whole cities.

It's possible to combine the last two strategies for swift and effective scaling.

## 8- Survive Kafka outages. 

The producer has been updated so that it can handle Kafka full outages by writing messages to disk with 0 message loss.

The idea is to not keep messages in a queue or in the kafka producer queue when no brokers are avaialable, this will ensure not keeping data in Memory and will avoid crashing the app when dealing with big volume and velocity.

When no brokers are available, the app will flush queue data to a file, and when kafka is available again data in the file will be put in the queue.

Before ellaborating the architecture, two vital points for interacting with kafka from python will be discussed.

 ##### Python Kafka producer: 
 If a broker issue/disconnection happens, python kafka producer will not return any error even when the whole cluster is down, and even when                            its own queue gets full (buffer_memory), instead it will delete the oldest messages.
 

 ##### Health check: 
 For doing continious healthcheck on brokers, KafkaAdminClient has been used. For simplicity, Its assumed that if KafkaAdminClient can connect to a broker and validate topic creation, then it's enough to ensure that we can produce using this broker.
 
However this aprroach is not deterministic for multiple reasons.

For example the rate of publishing using a broker can be unexpectedly limited. In this case we need statistics about the rate of publishing lets call it publishing_rate, if we have a heavy stream, the rate of receiving messages from the stream might be higher than publishin_rate at certain times due to network limitations, and this will result in accumulation in the producer's buffer_memory until it reaches its limit and starts deleting older messages.

In cases where the publishing_rate is lower than a the stream_rate over a certain time, the Health check should label that as a kafka outage.

Concretely, it would be better and easier to monitor the buffer_memory of the producer, for example if the buffer_memory reaches 70 % of its total size, the Health check should label that as a Kafka outage and switch to writing in disk,The suggested method requires modification of the kafka producer in kafka-python so that it can return the size of the buffer_memory.

Error rates should also be taken in consideration, if the data error rate is too high, the health check should signal this as a kafka outage.

### Architecture
The architecture consists of 5 threads described below:

#### 1- Streamer: 
Always streaming data from twitter to a queue.

#### 2- check_brokers_and_switch_condition: 
Acts as a circuit switcher, Will perform continious health checks on kafka brokers, will return the available number of kafka brokers, and set/unset two events accordingly (one_broker_is_up,all_brokers_are_down)

#### 3- produce to kafka:
Takes messages from queue and sends it to kafka when the event one_broker_is_up is set. The event is set by the previous thread if at least one broker is up.

#### 4- queue to file:
Will flush elements of queue to file when all_brokers_are_down is set. The event is set when all brokers are down.

#### 5- file to queue:
Will read elements from file and add it to queue when the event one_broker_is_up is set.

In practice, the streamer and circuit switcher are always working:

If at least one broker is up, the thread "produce to kafka" will get messages from queue and send it to kafka.
Concurrently, if there is any data in the file, the thread "file to queue" will put it in the queue.

If all brokers are down, the thread "queue to file" will get data from Queue and send it to the temp file
