    """
    Takes broker lists, and two events "one_broker_is_up, all_brokers_are_down" .

    Acts as an event switcher to be run as a seperate and continious thread, will count available brokers, and switch events.
    
    The event acts as a boolean in the While loop in queue_to_file, , will retrun true when it's set, and will hold the execution if it's unset.

    If no brokers are available, it will set all_brokers_are_down and unset one_broker_is_up
    
    If at least one broker is up, it will unset all_brokers_are_down and set one_broker_is_up

    all_brokers_are_down and one_broker_is_up will always be set to have opposit logic( one is set, the other is cleared), 
    technically they have the same meaning, and each will be used as an event trigger in opposit functions.

    The reason they are both used is that event does not return false it will wait, so two events are needed to alternate between functions.
